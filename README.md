# Set Default Browser
Silently sets the default web browser in Windows 10

# Requirements
Windows 10 version 1709 or below. **Versions 1803 and higher are not supported** since this app uses UI automation for a control panel applet that is now removed from Windows.

# Alternative
Someone has made a similar app that claims to change the default browser directly rather than using UI automation, so it might be more reliable than this one. You can get it [here](http://kolbi.cz/blog/?p=396).

# Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/sampalmer/windows-change-default-browser/releases)

# Usage
`SetDefaultBrowser "Google Chrome"`

Run the program without any arguments for more information.
