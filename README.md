# Set Default Browser
Silently sets the default web browser in Windows 10

# Requirements
Windows 10 version 1709 or below. **Versions 1803 and higher are not supported.**

# Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/sampalmer/windows-change-default-browser/releases)

# Usage
`SetDefaultBrowser "Google Chrome"`

Run the program without any arguments for more information.

# Compatibility
Written for Windows 10. Works by automating the Control Panel user interface, so this may stop working in a future Windows update.

# Alternative
It looks like someone else has made a similar app with the same name. That one claims to change the default browser directly rather than using UI automation, so it might be more reliable than this one. You can get it [here](http://kolbi.cz/blog/?p=396). Please note that I have not tested it myself.
